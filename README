I recently started to liberate myself from using an excellent, preassembled vim configuration.
Instead I try to build up a custom vim configuration. I hope that this will give me some more
insights into the plugins, how they are used and how to best map them. 

I'll store this configuration and all other bash scripts I want to share between different computers
in this repository.
